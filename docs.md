# 3-Week Project Plan: Multimodal LLM Evaluation System

## Week 1: Foundational Setup & Core Architecture

### Back-End Setup
1. Set up infrastructure using Hugging Face Gradio/Streamlit for evaluating models across text, image, and audio modalities.
2. Integrate Pinecone for vector storage and similarity search.
3. Set up APIs to manage the evaluation pipeline and interactions between services.

### Front-End Setup (Next.js)
4. Establish a basic Next.js front-end with a user-friendly dashboard layout.
5. Create routes for displaying core evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, etc.).
6. Build forms for model uploads and evaluation requests, enabling interaction with backend APIs.

### Evaluation Metrics Framework
7. Define and structure the eight core metrics: Accuracy, Hallucination, Groundedness, Relevance, Recall, Precision, Consistency, and Bias Detection.
8. Develop an initial pipeline for detecting biases and inconsistencies.

### Basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Setup
9. Implement a basic RAG model for context-based output generation to simulate ground truth for model evaluation.
10. Integrate Pinecone for context retrieval to assess model performance without labeled ground truth.
11. Use RAG to identify hallucinations, inconsistencies, and biases by retrieving relevant content for comparison.

## Week 2: Core Feature Development: Multimodal LLM Evaluation

### Evaluation Pipeline
1. Build the evaluation pipeline to assess models across text, images, and audio modalities using the eight core metrics.
2. Integrate Hugging Face, Pinecone, and Gradio/Streamlit for running evaluations and storing results.

### No Ground Truth Dependency
3. Finalize the logic for evaluating models without labeled data by leveraging RAG and Pinecone for similarity search.
4. Implement a system to flag models with issues like hallucinations or inconsistencies.

### Front-End Integration (Next.js)
5. Display real-time metrics and performance insights on the dashboard.
6. Track model performance over time, showing developers key areas for improvement.

### UMAP Integration
7. Implement UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for dimensionality reduction and visualization of high-dimensional data.
8. Integrate UMAP visualizations into the dashboard to provide insights into model behavior and performance.

### Worst Performing Slice Analysis
9. Develop functionality to identify and analyze the worst-performing data slices for each model.
10. Create visualizations and reports for these underperforming slices to guide targeted improvements.

## Week 3: Testing, Model Optimization & Deployment

### Automated Evaluation Pipeline
1. Ensure the evaluation pipeline can automatically detect biases, hallucinations, and inconsistencies.
2. Create a system that records where models go wrong, flagging areas like bias or hallucination for future fine-tuning.

### Model Optimization
3. Generate a list of errors (e.g., biases, hallucinations) that the model made during evaluation.
4. Use this list to fine-tune the model later, allowing for incremental improvement based on accumulated feedback.

### API and Library Development
5. Design and implement a robust API for external developers to integrate the evaluation system into their workflows.
6. Create a Python library that wraps the API, making it easy for developers to use the evaluation system programmatically.
7. Develop comprehensive documentation for both the API and the library.

### Final Testing & Deployment
8. Test the system for end-to-end functionality between the front end (Next.js) and back end (Gradio/Streamlit).
9. Conduct thorough testing of the API and library to ensure reliability and ease of use.
10. Launch the Product with core features: 
    - Multimodal LLM evaluation
    - Automated evaluation pipeline
    - No ground truth dependency
    - User-friendly dashboard with UMAP visualizations
    - Worst performing slice analysis
    - Error tracking for future fine-tuning
    - API and Python library for external integration

You are tasked with generating synthetic data on the topic of machine learning. Your goal is to create a diverse set of prompts, contexts, and responses that vary in different aspects such as accuracy, hallucination, groundedness, relevance, recall, precision, consistency, and bias detection.

Generate the data in the following JSON format:
```json
{
  "prompt": "Question or instruction about a machine learning concept",
  "context": "Background information or source material related to the prompt",
  "response": "An AI-generated response to the prompt, which may vary in accuracy and other aspects"
}
```

For each entry, vary the following aspects:
1. Accuracy: Range from completely accurate to partially or entirely inaccurate.
2. Hallucination: Include some responses with made-up information not present in the context.
3. Groundedness: Vary how well the response is grounded in the provided context.
4. Relevance: Create some responses that are highly relevant and others that are off-topic.
5. Recall: Vary how much of the relevant information from the context is included in the response.
6. Precision: Alter the specificity of the responses, from very precise to overly general.
7. Consistency: Include some responses that contradict the context or themselves.
8. Bias Detection: Incorporate some prompts and responses that may contain various biases.

Generate diverse prompts covering different areas of machine learning, such as algorithms, models, evaluation metrics, data preprocessing, and applications. Ensure that the contexts provide relevant background information, potentially including references to textbooks or research papers.

Create <NUM_PROMPTS> unique entries, each differing in the aspects mentioned above. Ensure a good distribution of variations across all generated entries.

To maintain diversity:
- Use a variety of machine learning topics and concepts
- Vary the length and complexity of prompts, contexts, and responses
- Include both theoretical and practical machine learning questions
- Incorporate different types of inaccuracies and biases

Output your generated data as a JSON array, with each entry following the specified format. Enclose the entire output within <synthetic_data> tags.

Begin generating the synthetic data now.


when the user in the custom model uploads a context.txt, chunk that and send to pinecone, and query the database with the user prompt to find the relevent content and compare that with the response we get by the llm, also when the prompt, context response is saved in the mongodb later, the context should be the retrieved context from pinecone, dont remove anything else
