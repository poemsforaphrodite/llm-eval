# Multimodal LLM Evaluation System

## Project Overview
A system designed to evaluate multimodal Language Learning Models (LLMs) across text, image, and audio modalities using Streamlit for both the frontend and backend.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: Streamlit frontend and backend application.
- `docs.md`: Detailed project plan and documentation.
- `docs.nd`: Additional documentation notes.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project overview and setup instructions.
- `.gitignore`: Git ignore file to exclude unnecessary files from the repository.

## Future Work
- Implement the backend logic within `app.py` to fully handle model uploads and evaluations.
- Integrate Pinecone for vector storage and similarity search.
- Enhance the dashboard section to visualize metrics using libraries like `matplotlib` or `plotly`.
- Add UMAP visualizations and worst-performing slice analysis features.
- Develop comprehensive documentation for the API and library integrations.
